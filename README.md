# WHAT IS A GIF?

[GIPHY](http://www.giphy.com) is an animated [GIF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Interchange_Format) search engine. The GIPHY API is a series of JSON read endpoints that allow you to integrate the features of GIPHY's search engine into your project or app. 

# SUMMARY

On this GIPHY Project, I've created a space for users to stubmle upon places to travel within the cities they choose. As giphy library does not let users to filter specific type of images and only filter by keywords, users have to scroll through random gifs in which some might not relate to travel at all.  

# APP FUNCTIONS

This application allows users to click and load pre-assigned gifs (top buttons). It also allows users to add their own places to travel through the giphy database. Users are able to animate the gifs by clicking once and also stop the gifs by clicking once again.  

# OBSTACLES

The main obstable for this project was calling the GIPHY API and using jQuery to change the HTML and CSS attribute. Adding new buttons and creating function to animate gifs with onlicks were challenging, however it became easier when sketching the overall application.
